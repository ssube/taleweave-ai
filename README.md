## Features

TaleWeave AI offers a range of features for gamers, developers, and researchers. It is a:

- multiplayer text adventure
- Discord role-playing game
- emergent behavior laboratory
- life simulator
- survival game
- game engine
- world generator
- human-machine interface
- multi-user dungeon
- cross-platform gaming experience
- behavior experiment

TaleWeave AI does a few things out of the box:

- Generate a world from a brief text prompt
- Simulate the actions of characters in that world
- Allow humans to interact with each other and with NPCs
- Track detailed status for each entity: mood, hunger, thirst, hygiene, time of day, weather, etc
- Summarize the environment into LLM prompts
- Foster emergent behavior through action digests, shared environment, and note taking

TaleWeave AI can:

- Be modified in almost every way - everything is a plugin, including the planning-action loop that drives the simulation
- Be run locally - does not require any cloud services, but does play nicely with them
- Connect to your data - game systems can fetch data for RAG
- Export training data for fine tuning character models
- Plug in to your workflow - run the simulation step by step in Jupyter notebooks as a Python library
- Connect to your server and vice versa - the Discord bot is a plugin and can be replaced with your favorite chat platform
